    This class is related to the way that enums are handled in C.  It
    is intended to be subclassed rather than instantiated directly.
  
    Each subclass comprises an independent type which is suitable for
    type checking as well as a grouping of (name, code, closure)
    triples.  Each instance of a subclass represents a specific (name,
    code, closure) triple.  Within a subclass, items can be looked up
    by name or by code or traversed by name or by code.
  
    For example::
  
        import coding
  
        class PeopleCoding(coding.Coding):
  
            \"""
            This is a group of people.  Closure is used here as a
            description but in other subclasses it could be used to
            represent just about anything including function pointers
        or closures.
            \"""
            bycode = byname = {} # so PeopleCoding will have it's own
                                 # dicts rather than sharing those of
                                 # the base class
  
        PeopleCoding('Bob', 1, 'This code represents Bob.')
        PeopleCoding('Carol', 2, 'Carol represented here')
        PeopleCoding('Ted', 3, 'Better Ted than Fred')
        PeopleCoding('Alice', 4, 'Doesn\'t live here anymore')
  
    You can now lookup codes::
  
        PeopleCoding.byname['Bob'].code
  
    Or names::
  
        PeopleCoding.bycode[3].name
  
    Closures by code::
  
        PeopleCoding.bycode[3].closure
  
    Or by name::
  
        PeopleCoding.byname['Bob'].closure
  
    Type conversions work as one might expect and, for convenience,
    the call value of an instance is the closure::
  
        x = PeopleCoding.bycode[3]
        assert x.name == str(x)
        assert x.code == int(x)
        assert x.closure == x()
  
    You can list all codes in this class::
  
        [code for code in PeopleCoding.bycode]
  
    Or all names::
  
        [name for name in PeopleCoding.byname]
  
    You can test for inclusion by name::
  
        'Herman' in PeopleCoding.byname
  
    Or by code::
  
        2 in PeopleCoding.bycode
  
    Note that each subclass of Coding represents a unique type::
  
        assert isinstance(PeopleCoding.bycode[3], PeopleCoding)
  
    .. note:: Also note that codings should be considered immutable.
  
    .. todo:: Since the class wraps access to data attibutes, there's
        no reason it couldn't rework the dictionaries to support
        mutable instances.  (Just make sure that when removing items
        from a dict, we remove the right items rather than some other
        item with the same key.)
  
    .. todo:: support for removing instances.
  
    .. todo:: class should include an aggregator for all instances.
        This will be different from iterating over the dicts when
        field overloading is in effect.
